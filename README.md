## Opinion
I think this article is interesting for a couple reasons. For one, I think it's cool to see in what way major companies such as Google and Apple are deciding to contribute to the fight against the pandemic. Apparently they teamed up together, which is awesome. Since a large majority of people have Google and Apple phones, the products they've developed will be sure to reach this large majority very easily. I also think the article is interesting simply because it discusses topics that we've covered very recently in class, such as centralized servers.

*I also read an article pertaining to software development in regards to the pandemic. It is so interesting to see how tech has been influenced by COVID-19. From digital contact tracing to improving robots (which is in my article) there are endless possiblities to fight the pandemic. I am curious as to how others have also incorporated technology into this. - Michelle Han*
