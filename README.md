[Apple and Google release test version of coronavirus tracing software](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/apple-and-google-release-test-version-of-coronavirus-tracing-software.html).

## Opinion
I think this article is interesting for a couple reasons. For one, I think it's cool to see in what way major companies such as Google and Apple are deciding to contribute to the fight against the pandemic.

I also think the article is interesting simply because it discusses topics that we've covered very recently in class, such as centralized servers.
